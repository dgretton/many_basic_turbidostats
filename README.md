# Pyhamilton example: Many turbidostats

**Basic implementation for clarity without asynchrony and other optimizations.**

Cyclically replace media in microplate wells containing bacterial cultures using a high-level controller to maintain each culture independently at a constant optical density (OD). Estimates culture growth rate in real time. Utilizes [pyhamilton](https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton), Python for Hamilton liquid handling robots, for robot control. Controller simulation included.
